## Description
The **Student Management System** is a web-based application built using JsonPowerDB (JPDB) as the backend. It provides functionalities to manage student records efficiently, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting student data. The system ensures simplicity, performance, and ease of use, leveraging the power of JsonPowerDB's NoSQL database capabilities.

JsonPowerDB is a high-performance NoSQL database designed for real-time applications. This project demonstrates how JPDB can be effectively used to create a lightweight, fast, and scalable student management system.
